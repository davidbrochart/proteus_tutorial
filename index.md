This lesson is an introduction to fluid-structure interaction modeling
with the Proteus two-phase flow application, including a brief
introduction to programming in Python for people with little or no
previous Python programming experience.  This lesson references the Jupyter
Notebook, but can be taught using a regular Python interpreter as
well.  Please note that this lesson uses Python 3 rather than Python
2.
