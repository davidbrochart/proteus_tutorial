title: "Floating Structures"
teaching: 45
exercises: 45
questions:
- "What is Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI)?"
- "How can I model moving solid structures?"
- "What is the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian approach to FSI?"
- "What is the Immersed Finite Element approach to FSI?"
- "What is added mass?"
objectives:
- "Enable ALE simulations of flooting and moored structures."
keypoints:
- "ALE can be accurate and robust event for large deformations and rotations but does not support collisions easily."
